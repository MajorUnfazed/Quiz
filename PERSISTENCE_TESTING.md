3. **Expected**: Page updates immediately with new theme
4. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
5. **Expected**: Theme preference is preserved

### **Test 2: Session Persistence - Login**
1. If logged in, click "Logout" first
2. Login with your credentials
3. **Expected**: See "Your session will be saved" message
4. Navigate around the app (start screen, leaderboard, etc.)
5. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
6. **Expected**: Automatically logged back in, no auth screen shown

### **Test 3: Session Persistence - Browser Restart**
1. Ensure you're logged in
2. Close the browser completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
4. **Expected**: Automatically logged in, no auth screen shown

### **Test 4: Quiz Configuration Persistence**
1. From start screen, click "Play Solo Quiz"
2. Change settings:
   - Set question amount to 15
   - Choose a specific category (e.g., "Science & Nature")
   - Set difficulty to "Medium"
   - Toggle timer off
3. Click "Start Quiz"
4. Complete or exit the quiz
5. Start a new quiz configuration
6. **Expected**: All previous settings are preserved

### **Test 5: Logout Functionality**
1. While logged in, click "Logout" button
2. **Expected**: See "Logged out successfully" message
3. **Expected**: Redirected to auth screen
4. Refresh the page
5. **Expected**: Still on auth screen (session cleared)
6. **Expected**: Theme preference still preserved

### **Test 6: Cross-Browser Persistence**
1. Login and set preferences in Chrome
2. Open Firefox/Edge and navigate to the same URL
3. **Expected**: Each browser maintains independent session state
4. Login separately in the second browser
5. **Expected**: Both browsers work independently

### **Test 7: Network Failure Handling**
1. Login and ensure you're on the start screen
2. Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)

- `quizzical_preferences` - User preferences including quiz config

### **Security Features**
- Passwords are never stored locally
- Session validation against server

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **If Session Doesn't Persist**
1. Check browser's localStorage in DevTools (F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage)
2. Verify server is running on http://localhost:5000
3. Check console for JavaScript errors

### **If Theme Doesn't Save**
1. Try toggling theme multiple times
2. Check if browser has localStorage disabled
3. Clear localStorage and test again

### **If Quiz Config Doesn't Save**
1. Ensure you clicked "Start Quiz" (not just back button)
2. Check that preferences are being saved in localStorage
3. Verify the config screen loads the correct initial values
